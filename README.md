# Spy Duo

## 🎮 Description of the Game "Spy Duo"

**Spy Duo** is an exciting adaptation of the classic "Spy" game for two players. The goal? To uncover whether your locations match — but you’ll need to rely on clever, indirect questions to find out! 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♀️

### 📜 Rules

1. **🔑 Start of the Game:**  
   Each player receives one of two random locations. For example:  
   - Player 1: "Subway" 🚇  
   - Player 2: "Hospital" 🏥  

2. **🎯 Objective:**  
   Use your wits to determine if the locations match by asking questions.

3. **🔄 Game Flow:**  
   Players take turns asking each other questions. These must be indirect, such as:  
   - "How often do you visit this place?"  
   - "What do you like about this place?"  

4. **❓ Direct Question:**  
   Each player has **one chance** to ask a direct question:  
   - Player 1: "Is it a hospital?" 🏥  
     - If the answer is yes, Player 1 wins! 🎉  
   - Player 1: "Is it a subway?" 🚇  
     - If the answer is no, Player 1 loses. 😢  

### 🏆 Victory  
The game ends when:  
- One player correctly determines whether the locations match or not.  
- A player successfully guesses the exact location with their direct question.  
Are you ready to outsmart your opponent and claim victory? 🚀
